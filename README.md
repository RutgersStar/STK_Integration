# STK_Integration
Using Python to automate simulations and analysis in STK

Goals

> Create these objects (save somewhere)
  - Satellites (6 orbit elements, etc)
  - Places (longitude latitude, etc)
  - Sensors (parent object, constraints, etc)
  - Access (between object 1 and object 2)
  
> Remove objects (from saved list)
  - Easy to read and remove
  
> Load objects in STK
  - Add objects (satellites, places, sensors)
  - Compute access (from sensor object to target object)
  - Save reports (text file or csv file)
  
> Perform analysis on reports
  - read text files into Python
  - plot data in a variety of ways (tbd once we get here)
